Hello!
This is my first project based on Weather Forecasting of a City.I have made this project during the 7 days Bootcamp oraganised by SHAPEAI .The instructor was Mr.Harsh Akshit Student Lead at GOOGLE
He was incredibly knowledgeable and articulate.He helped us alot. I have learned many new things and it was a great experience.

Through this Bootcamp i have learned about the basics of Python and I've got to know and learn more about Cybersecurity and I am also interested to gain more knowledge about it.

Overall it was a great experience and I enjoyed it.
